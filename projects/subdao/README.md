# [SubDAO](https://www.subdao.network/)

## Project Introduction

SubDAO is a DAO infrastructure based on Polkadot, where any decentralized organization is allowed to conveniently create and manage a DAO. SubDAO does not only connect DAO with DApps to realize DAO’s cross-chain management, but also bridges Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.

Through SubDAO’s Web2.0 middleware, users can implement DAO governance directly on traditional social platforms. Developers can quickly integrate DAO governance in their blockchain, web pages, iOS/Android mobile devices and PC applications through the SubDAOO Airfone SDK. In addition, SubDAO’s series of templates and ecosystem tools allow DAO to implement various decentralized application scenarios such as crypto assets management, credit lending, and instant messaging.

## Wasm contract technical support
SubDAO, Polkadot DAO infrastructure announces that it has reached strategic cooperation with Patract, a Wasm smart contract solution provider for Polkadot.
SubDAO will develop ink! smart contract based on Patract's Redspot tool, allowing DApp developers to easily integrate DAO organization management templates, functions and data on SubDAO. Therefore, developers can customize their own DAO management tools according to their own decentralized organization needs.
SubDAO will also expand the contract running sandbox environment Europa provided by Patract to secure the underlying blockchain and directly simulate the core contract functions of SubDAO, such as treasury management, proposals, and consignments. In addition, Patract will use SubDAO as the management tool for its related DAO organizations, including the Wasm contract standard definition DAO that Patract is launching, the Wasm developer community DAO for developer incentives, and the Patractpen Platform DAO. The ultimate goal of SubDAO is to provide an open SDK for the Polkadot ecosystem so as to promote the common development of DApp and DAO in the Polkadot ecosystem.
